  I''m a full-time nerd with a <b>Masters in  Information Engineering</b> at Cambridge University, currently working as a Business Analyst at <b>McKinsey & Company + QuantumBlack</b> in London. I support clients to develop and deploy data-driven solutions to improve the operational efficiency of systems and processes in a range of industries. As part of my undergrad, I also studied for a year at MIT through the Cambridge-MIT Exchange.
  <br/><br/>
  In the past, I have interned in both Software Engineering and Product Management roles at a UK-leading startup, and have researched for NASA at MIT. My Masters thesis involved developing algorithms for automatic lung auscultation and I have also published workshop papers at NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR.

  Please feel free to reach out (contact details below) if you are interested in getting in touch. For your interest, my resume can be found below - I am particularly interested in opportunities in either Silicon Valley or Boston. I am looking forward to hearing from you!'
